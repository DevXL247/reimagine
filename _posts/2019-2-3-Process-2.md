## Overview of Entry
We've started to have some trouble managing our time in this project, although we've come quite a long way from the beginning. We've tried to accomplish some of the goals that we set back in January, and for most of them, we've only just started. For example, we think that the website should now be using React.js, rather than Jekyll. The project is starting to get confusing for both of us, and we think that it's time to retrace our steps and sit down and really think our project through.

## Goals set in January

### Get in touch with organizations

## Acheivements

### Talked to Mrs. Dube, Mr. Johncox, and Mrs. Gahunia
To help find data for our project, we contacted Mrs. Dube (our principal), Mr. Johncox (our Community Project Advisor).

### Talked to Zebra Robotics, Mr. Kern, and Mr. Dobby

### Created a prototype of the website
We've started creating a website four our clients to use, and when we hand out flyers or other advertisement methods, we'll be able to show them this.

We're using the Tachyons Functional CSS Library, and using some clever programming techniques, we can make it work on every device, not just desktop.

We're using the Duo template, by @chibicode, for rapid design of our website, along with the Jekyll Ruby library, which has blogging built into it. This allows us to add posts whenever we want, and update our community project as we go.

### Started the advertising and marketing
We've decided to name our project Reimagine, because it combines the two parts of our project: imagining what computers can do, and reimaging them.

We've started to create materials


### Created Monday.com accounts
As we said in our last process journal update, we decided that having a good Project Management Solution will be key to our success in this project, and so we created Monday.com accounts to organize ourselves better.

We decided to use Monday.com because it allows us to share files, and assign tasks to people, all being free, making it a great deal for students like us that don't need a huge management system.

### Found a Linux Distribution
We've done some searching around, and we've collectively decided that LUbuntu will be the best option for us. It's designed to be run on lower-tier hardware, but is still powerful enough for anyone's needs. It can run almosst anything that you throw at it, and it is just a little underpowered than the full-fledged Ubuntu.

However, we think that if people choose to have Windows on their computer for whatever reason, then we should definitely honour that decision, and leave the computer as-is.

## Goals Set

### Find a computer retailer or donator
Obviously, our ultimate goal will be to actually find computers. However, this is proving to be quite difficult, and so for the next month, it won't be the focus of our project. Rather, our focus will be put on creating infrastructure to give computers out to people, rather than actually getting the computers. However, it is a good idea to find a good place that we can get computers from, so that we aren't stressing come time for
