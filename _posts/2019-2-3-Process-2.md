## Overview of Entry
We think that we've made good progress on our project. We've completed most of the goals that we set in January, and we're looking forward to working more on our project in the future months. We'll mostly be working on the website and contacting people for the computers, as well as focusing a little bit on the infrastructure

## Goals set in January

### Get in touch with organizations for computers
We decided to find more organizations that can supply us with computers back in January.

### Start the website, and try to finish it
Rather self-explanatory, we decided to start making the website, and making sure that it actually looks good.

## Acheivements

### Talked to Mrs. Dube, Mr. Johncox, and Mrs. Gahunia
To help find data for our project, we contacted Mrs. Dube (our principal), Mr. Johncox (our Community Project Advisor), and Mrs. Gahunia (the guidance counselor)

We talked to Mr. Johncox about our idea of contacting the other two for information, and he said that it is a pretty good idea, and told us about the idea of contacting Mrs. Gahunia for better information; she governs more of the student body.

We approached Mrs. Dube about information, and also about confirming taking delivery of the computers from Hitech, and she said that she could do both, so we're just waiting on a response.

### Created a prototype of the website
We've started creating a website four our clients to use, and when we hand out flyers or other advertisement methods, we'll be able to show them this.

We're using the Tachyons Functional CSS Library, and using some clever programming techniques, we can make it work on every device, not just desktop.

We're using the Duo template, by @chibicode, for rapid design of our website, along with the Jekyll Ruby library, which has blogging built into it. This allows us to add posts whenever we want, and update our community project as we go.

### Screenshots of our website prototype

Quite obviously, these are only prototypes, and there will be some considerable changes to how the website looks before we can actually distribute it.

### Started the advertising and marketing
We've decided to name our project Reimagine, because it combines the two parts of our project: imagining what computers can do, and reimaging them.

We've started to create materials for advertising, such as a logo, and as we said before, the website.

Dev also came up with the good idea of creating slides for the announcements that we could use, but we decided not to use them because it would be benefitting the school, which we were told wasn't the point of the project.


### Created Monday.com accounts
As we said in our last process journal update, we decided that having a good Project Management Solution will be key to our success in this project, and so we created Monday.com accounts to organize ourselves better.

We decided to use Monday.com because it allows us to share files, and assign tasks to people, all being free, making it a great deal for students like us that don't need a huge management system.

### Found a Linux Distribution
We've done some searching around, and we've collectively decided that LUbuntu will be the best option for us. It's designed to be run on lower-tier hardware, but is still powerful enough for anyone's needs. It can run almosst anything that you throw at it, and it is just a little underpowered than the full-fledged Ubuntu.

However, we think that if people choose to have Windows on their computer for whatever reason, then we should definitely honour that decision, and leave the computer as-is.

## Goals Set

### Find a computer retailer or donator
Obviously, our ultimate goal will be to actually find computers. However, this is proving to be quite difficult, and so for the next month, it won't be the focus of our project. Rather, our focus will be put on creating infrastructure to give computers out to people, rather than actually getting the computers. However, it is a good idea to find a good place that we can get computers from, so that we aren't stressing come time for March or April.

### Finish the website
In order for us to start advertising, it is necessary for us to finish the website, so that clients can see the actual project details.

### Get data on schools and people
For the project to work, we need data on the people that we're distributing computers to, and so we need to get that from a source other than teachers, like through a survey of some sort.
