## Overview of Entry
As the description says, the progress on our community project has begun to slow down. Back in February, in our [last entry](/reimagine/posts/Process-2){:.bg-animate .no-underline .bg-{{site.brand_color}}}, we said that we were making good progress. However, with Mrs. Dube not sending an email to Hitech as we asked her to, our project will be pushed back quite far. We've completed the website and all the markup for that, and contacted a lot of organizations.

## Acheivements

### Completed Website
We've finally finished off the website for our Community Project, and we think that it looks pretty cool.

On the homepage, it features the different parts of our Community Project, like who we are, the project details, and the Blog with the Process Journal (we've decided to host it all online, so that anyone can see our progress).

### Contacted organizations
We recognized that the main problem that we'd face would be actually getting the computers; we know that there are many people that would be ready to accept computers, in both of our neighbourhoods.

Originally, we had a plan to finish our project by mid-March, by using computers from Hitech Recycling, because they seemed really willing to donate. However, they asked for the principal of the school to email them about the project details, so that they knew that we weren't scamming them. A totally understandable idea, so we went to Mrs. Dube and told her all about it, and she agreed to talk to them, so long as we sent her an email template to send her. We agreed, and so Dev sent her one not long after.

However, we never received any form of confirmation email or anything from her side, and so we assumed that she had sent the email and forgotten about this. However, we also realized that the people over at Hitech would've responded to us if this were the case. Because they didn't, we know that she didn't send it. To make sure that this was the case, we tried setting up meetings with her, but for some reason or the other, her schedule and ours didnt' match up, so we gave up after a while. So, right now, we are stranded with a couple of months left to go, and no computers to speak of.
