Today, we got our first batch of computers from Mr. Kern at Brampton Centennial School, and we are *very* pleased with the result.

### Computers
We've received a total of 10 computers, but we still have yet to test how many work.

## Next Steps & Other work
Both Dev and I are in a state of euphoria right now; all of the computers that we've gotten are amazing, not to mention all of the additional supplies that Mr. Kern brought in. However, this doesn't mean that the project is done yet. We still have a fair amount of work left to do, which we think will be fine.

## Other Updates
Previously, we said that we'd be using a Linux Distribution called LUbuntu, but we've changed that, because we think that it isn't extendible enough for our needs. The point of this project is to supply the easiest-to-use computers possible, so something such as LUbuntu isn't very well-suited for our needs.

The new distribution that we've chosen is called XUbuntu, and the only large difference between LUbuntu and XUbuntu is that the latter uses a different window manager; rather than using the GNOME 3.0 interface, it uses XFCE, the first letter of which is the namesake of the operating system.

Both of the operating systems are rather lightweight, but we feel like using XUbuntu will give us better performance than the other one; we're using technology from the last decade, literally.
