If you're reading this post, you most likely are part of the Reimagine project in some way. Be it a teacher, a student and/or the person who is receiving a computer, you probably want to know more about what the words and phrases that we use are.

If this is the case, then obviously, you should read this post!

## Operating Systems
**Kernel**: The Kernel is the single most important part of an Operating System. It deals with the input/outputs of the system, and is the link between the interface and the hardware.

**Linux**: Linux is a Kernel, which some operating systems are built on.

**LUbuntu**: The Operating System we are going to be installing on the computers we give out. This is a lightweight operating system, meant to be run on very unpowerful hardware.

## Hardware Talk
**CPU**: The CPU is the main point of the computer, and stands for "Central Processing Unit". It is where all of the instructions for the computer are executed.

**Peripherals**: Peripherals are the things which provide input to the computer, such as a mouse or a keyboard. Without these, you would have no way of communicating with the computer.

**Output**: This word has many meanings, but when we use it, we more than likely use it in reference to how the computer shows its work, or in other words: the output of the computer.
