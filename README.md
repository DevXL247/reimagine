## The Team
Reimagine is made up of Dev Patel and <a href="https://github.com/rishiosaur" class="no-underline bg-{{ site.brand_color }}">Rishi Kothari</a>, students in the International Baccalaureate Program at W. G. Davis Senior Public School.

**Dev Patel** is a bold person, who likes taking risks. He is going to Turner Fenton Secondary School, along with Rishi, and is learning many different programming languages.

**Rishi Kothari** is a programmer by trade, but hacker by night. He loves to code, and is a prominent of <a href="https://hackclub.com" class="no-underline bg-{{ site.brand_color }}">Hack Club</a>.

## Project Details
We're doing this as part of our IB Community Project, which is a requirement in our cirriculum. For us, this meant following our interests as much as possible.

The biggest interest for both of us is Computer Science and Software Engineering, and so our project is about refurbishing old, used computers, and giving them away.

This not only benefits the community, but makes us happy as well!

## Contact
Both of us are always ready to chat about the project. Here are some of the ways that you can contact us.
